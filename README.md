# Diamond Explanatory Analysis and Visualizations

## Information on the Diamond Dataset
- The dataset contains the prices and attributes of approximately 54000 round cut diamonds
- The dataset contains 54000 rows and 10 columns:
    1. **price** - Price in dollars. Data was collected in 2008
    2. **carat** - Diamond weight, 1 carat is equal to 0.2 grams
    3. **cut** - Quality of diamond cut, affects its shine. Grades go from (low) Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal (best).
    4. **color** - Measure of diamond coloration. Increasing grades go from (some color) J, I, H, G, F, E, D (colorless).
    5. **clarity** - Measure of diamond inclusions. Increasing grades go from (inclusions) I1, SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (internally flawless).
    6. **x, y, z** - Diamond length, width and depth respectively, in mm
    7. **table** - Ratio of the width of the top surface of diamond to its overall width as a percentage
    8. **depth** - proportional depth of diamond as a percentage. This is computed as 2 * z / (x + y), or the ratio of the depth to the average of length and width.
